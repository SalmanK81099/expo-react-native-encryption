# HMAC-SHA256 Encryption Module for React Native Expo

This is a custom encryption module designed for React Native Expo projects. It provides an easy way to encrypt strings using the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm and returns a hexadecimal string as the output.

## Features
- Custom HMAC-SHA256 encryption.
- Simple to integrate into any React Native Expo project.
- Lightweight and efficient.



## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo



## Project Structure
The app consists of the following structure:
```
.
├── module
│   ├── expo-encryption // HMAC-SHA256 encryption logic
├── app/      // Entry point for the Expo app
├── package.json
└── other-app-files
```

The `module` folder contains the HMAC-SHA256 encryption logic.


Use your preferred device (Android or iOS) to run the app using Expo prebuild or a development client.
